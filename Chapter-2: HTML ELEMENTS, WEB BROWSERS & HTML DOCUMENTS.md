#HTML Editors

A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Windows 8 or later:

Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

Windows 7 or earlier:

Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)
Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit

Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"

Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".

Then open a new document to place the code.

Step 2: Write Some HTML
Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Step 3: Save the HTML Page
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.

Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).

Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference; it is up to you.

Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

#HTML Basic Examples
In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>

#HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

#HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
<a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>

The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.

#HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

#How to View HTML Source
Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"

View HTML Source Code:
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.

#HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Example Explained
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
The <body> element defines the document's body.

It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
The <h1> element defines a heading.

It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
The <p> element defines a paragraph.

It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>
#Never Skip the End Tag
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph

</body>
</html> 

#HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

#HTML Tag Reference
