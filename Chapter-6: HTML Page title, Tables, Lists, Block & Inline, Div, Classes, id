#HTML Page Title
Every web page should have a page title to describe the meaning of the page.

The <title> element adds a title to your page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>

The content of the document......

</body>
</html>

#The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

HTML Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

Example
Company	Contact	Country
Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany
Centro comercial Moctezuma	Francisco Chang	Mexico
Ernst Handel	Roland Mendel	Austria
Island Trading	Helen Bennett	UK
Laughing Bacchus Winecellars	Yoshi Tannamuri	Canada
Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti	Giovanni Rovelli	Italy
Define an HTML Table
A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.

Example
A simple HTML table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Table Cells
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.

td stands for table data.

Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Note: A table cell can contain all sorts of HTML elements: text, images, lists, links, other tables, etc.

Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.

tr stands for table row.

Example
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
You can have as many rows as you like in a table; just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.

#Table Headers
Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:

th stands for table header.

Example
Let the first row be table header cells:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person 1</th>
    <th>Person 2</th>
    <th>Person 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS.

HTML Table Tags
Tag	Description
<table>	Defines a table
<th>	Defines a header cell in a table
<tr>	Defines a row in a table
<td>	Defines a cell in a table
<caption>	Defines a table caption
<colgroup>	Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting
<col>	Specifies column properties for each column within a <colgroup> element
<thead>	Groups the header content in a table
<tbody>	Groups the body content in a table
<tfoot>	Groups the footer content in a table

#HTML Lists
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

Example
An unordered HTML list:

Item
Item
Item
Item
An ordered HTML list:

First item
Second item
Third item
Fourth item
Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

Example
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

#HTML Description Lists
HTML also supports description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

Example
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

#HTML List Tags
Tag	Description
<ul>	Defines an unordered list
<ol>	Defines an ordered list
<li>	Defines a list item
<dl>	Defines a description list
<dt>	Defines a term in a description list
<dd>	Describes the term in a description list

#HTML Block and Inline Elements
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

The two most common display values are block and inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Example
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

Example
<span>Hello World</span>
Here are the inline elements in HTML:

<a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>
Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

#The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

Example
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
You will learn more about the <div> element in the next chapter.

The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

Example
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

#HTML Div Element
The <div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> Element
The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

Example
A <div> element takes up all available width:

Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
Result
Lorem Ipsum
I am a div
dolor sit amet.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

<div> as a container
The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

Example
A <div> element with HTML elements:

<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.

#HTML Div Element
The <div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> Element
The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

Example
A <div> element takes up all available width:

Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
Result
Lorem Ipsum
I am a div
dolor sit amet.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

<div> as a container
The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

Example
A <div> element with HTML elements:

<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.


#Center align a <div> element
If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.

Example
<style>
div {
  width:300px;
  margin:auto;
}
</style>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.


Multiple <div> elements
You can have many <div> containers on the same page.

Example
<div>
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
  <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Oslo</h2>
  <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
  <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Rome</h2>
  <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
  <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.

Oslo
Oslo is the capital city of Norway.

Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.

Rome
Rome is the capital city of Italy.

Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.


Aligning <div> elements side by side
When building web pages, you often want to have two or more <div> elements side by side, like this:

London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.

Oslo
Oslo is the capital city of Norway.

Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.

Rome
Rome is the capital city of Italy.

Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.

There are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all include some CSS styling. We will look at the most common methods:

Float
The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.

The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allow elements float next to each other instead of on top of each other.

Example
How to use float to align div elements side by side:

<style>
.mycontainer {
  width:100%;
  overflow:auto;
}
.mycontainer div {
  width:33%;
  float:left;
}
</style>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.

Oslo
Oslo is the capital city of Norway.

Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.

Rome
Rome is the capital city of Italy.

Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.


Learn more about float in our CSS float tutorial.

Inline-block
If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.

Example
How to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side:

<style>
div {
  width: 30%;
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>
Result
London
London is the capital city of England.

London has over 13 million inhabitants.

 
Oslo
Oslo is the capital city of Norway.

Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.

 
Rome
Rome is the capital city of Italy.

Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.

#Flex
The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.

Example
How to use flex to align div elements side by side:

<style>
.mycontainer {
  display: flex;
}
.mycontainer > div {
  width:33%;
}
</style>

#Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.

Example
How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side:

<style>
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
}
</style> 

HTML Tags

<div>	Defines a section in a document (block-level)

#HTML class Attribute
The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

Using The class Attribute
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.note {
  font-size: 120%;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
<p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>

</body>
</html>
Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

Note: The class name is case sensitive!

#The Syntax For Class
To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:

Example
Create a class named "city":

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

</body>
</html>
Multiple Classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: 

Example
<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
Different Elements Can Share Same Class
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.

In the following example, both <h2> and <p> point to the "city" class and will share the same style:

Example
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p class="city">Paris is the capital of France</p>
Use of The class Attribute in JavaScript
The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements.

JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method:

Example
Click on a button to hide all elements with the class name "city":

<script>
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
  for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    x[i].style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>
Don't worry if you don't understand the code in the example above.

Chapter Summary
The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element
Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements
The class attribute can be used on any HTML element
The class name is case sensitive
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method

#HTML id Attribute
The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

Using The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>
Note: The id name is case sensitive!

Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

Difference Between Class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:

Example
<style>
/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>

<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, create a bookmark with the id attribute:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Using The id Attribute in JavaScript
The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.

JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method:

Example
Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:

<script>
function displayResult() {
  document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
}
</script>
Tip: Study JavaScript in the HTML JavaScript chapter, or in our JavaScript Tutorial.
